# 25 JavaScript Projects with Spring Boot

Welcome to the **25-JavaScript-Projects-with-Spring-Boot** repository! This repository is a collection of 25 JavaScript-based projects integrated with **Spring Boot** to create dynamic and interactive web applications. Each project focuses on a specific JavaScript feature or UI component, paired with a Spring Boot backend to handle server-side logic, API endpoints, and data management.

The goal of this repository is to showcase my journey of learning **JavaScript** and **Spring Boot** by building practical, real-world projects. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, feel free to explore, use, and contribute to these projects!

## ðŸŒŸ Introduction
This repository contains **25 projects** that combine the power of **JavaScript** for front-end development and **Spring Boot** for back-end development. Each project is designed to demonstrate a specific JavaScript concept (e.g., DOM manipulation, event handling, or UI components) while leveraging Spring Boot for creating RESTful APIs, managing data, and serving the front-end.

The projects range from beginner to intermediate level and are perfect for learning how to integrate JavaScript with a Java-based backend framework like Spring Boot.

## ðŸ“œ Project 1: Accordion

### Overview
The **Accordion** component is the first project in this repository. An accordion is a UI element that allows users to expand and collapse sections of content, making it ideal for FAQs, menus, or any content that needs to be organized in a compact, user-friendly way.

In this project, I created a simple accordion using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the front-end, with plans to integrate it with a **Spring Boot** backend to dynamically load content via API endpoints in the future.

---

### Features
- **Collapsible Sections**: Click on a section header to expand or collapse its content.
- **Single Selection**: Only one section can be open at a time (with an option to enable multi-selection in the UI).
- **Responsive Design**: The accordion is styled to be responsive and visually appealing.
- **Interactive UI**: Includes hover effects and a clean design inspired by modern web applications.

### Overview
The **Rating** component is the second project in this repository. It allows users to provide feedback by selecting a rating (1 to 5 stars). This UI feature is widely used in e-commerce websites, review systems, and applications requiring user input for satisfaction or performance.

---

### Features
- **Interactive Rating System**: Users can click on stars to select a rating.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays the selected rating dynamically.
- **Hover Effects**: Highlights stars during hover for better visual feedback.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the rating system looks good on all devices.

### Overview
The **Random Color Generator** is the third project in this repository. This project provides a simple and interactive tool for generating random colors, displaying their HEX and RGB codes, and allowing users to switch between the two formats. Itâ€™s a practical utility for designers, developers, or anyone needing quick access to random color codes for their projects.

In this project, I built the front-end using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to handle the color generation logic and UI updates. The plan is to integrate it with a **Spring Boot** backend in the future to potentially save generated colors or fetch color palettes via API endpoints.

---

### Features
- **Random Color Generation**: Click the "Random Color" button to generate a new color and update the background of the display area.
- **HEX and RGB Codes**: Displays the generated color in both HEX and RGB formats, with buttons to toggle between the two.
- **Interactive UI**: Buttons are styled with distinct colors (orange for "Random Color," blue for "HEX Code," and green for "RGB Code") for easy identification.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is clean and responsive, ensuring usability across different devices.

---

### Technologies Used
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-End**: *(To be integrated with Spring Boot for dynamic content loading)*
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with a brown and white color scheme, plus signs for expand/collapse indicators.
